Session 2 - I like your loop! It's a bit crude though, so next time try doing the same but using a for
loop or a while loop. In any case, thanks for submitting something!

Session 3 - Nice, I looked up Cebolihna... but what does the phrase mean?! Google can't translate it.

In any case, good work, I added a comment about the syntax in your documentation and it would
be great if you did a bit more of the questions, but I understand if you all are busy.

2016.10.25 - HW6 - You took a look, but was the assignment unclear? If
             you're having issues, let me know, or if you're just busy
             with other courses let me know that too.

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - only 8 submitted.
